# XSS Attack Testing with XSpear


## Description
This project demonstrates the process of detecting and exploiting Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities using the XSpear tool. XSpear is a security testing tool that helps identify XSS vulnerabilities in web applications.


## Tools Used
- XSpear: A tool used for XSS vulnerability scanning and exploitation.
- Kali Linux**: The operating system used for performing the tests.


## Prerequisites
Before running the tests, ensure you have the following installed:
- XSpear tool on Kali Linux
- Access to the target web application or a test environment


## Installation
1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khushijain21200/XSS_Attack.git




Instructions to Install XSpear on Kali Linux.

Requirements :
▶ Run : gem install colorize
▶ Run : gem install selenium-webdriver
▶ Run : gem install terminal-table
▶ Run : gem install progress_bar

Method  from Package:
▶ Run : gem install XSpear
▶ Run (Check) : XSpear -h or XSpear --version.

▶ Run (Usage / Example) : XSpear -u http://testasp.vulnweb.com/Search.asp?tfSearch=ok -v 1


## Results

-You will see the vulnerabilities in the target site.



### Additional Tips

- Clarity: Make sure each section is clear and provides enough detail for someone to understand how to use XSpear for XSS testing.
- Links: If possible, provide links to XSpear documentation or related resources.
- Examples: Use real examples of how XSpear was used to find vulnerabilities, including payloads and test cases.

This structure will help others understand your project, replicate your tests, and see the results of your XSS testing using XSpear.
