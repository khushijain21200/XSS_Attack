ðŸ’¡ How to Secure Yourself Against XSS Attacks:

Validate Input:

Always validate and sanitize user inputs on both client and server sides to prevent malicious code from being executed.
Escape Outputs:

Ensure that data sent to the browser is properly escaped. For HTML content, use HTML entity encoding to neutralize any potentially dangerous characters.
Use Security Headers:

Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded and executed.
Employ Secure Libraries:

Use well-maintained libraries and frameworks that have built-in protections against XSS.
Regular Security Audits:

Regularly audit your web applications for vulnerabilities using automated tools and manual testing.
